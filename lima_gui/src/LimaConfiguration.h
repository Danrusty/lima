/// My problems :

/// You cannot edit easily the configuration structure. You cannot overwrite a module or a group that already exists without
/// modifying the source code of the class. Doing so may create udnefined behavior in the rest of Lima;
/// One solution would be to create a class specifically for this; still needs to see if xmlConfigurationFileParser
/// and its structures classes have a compatible visibility police.

/// In any case, it would require to create specific xml configuration files for the custom configurations.
/// Not with their own syntax, but the syntax found in files lima-lp-<lang>.xml for instance.
/// The thing is, do we want a configuration that is specific  to one language ? Because that's where
/// we are headed for now.
///
/// Or we could have the custom configurations have their own
///     lima-analysis.xml
///     X lima-lp-<lang>.xml
/// in config/custom/<name>/
///
/// But configuration files are separated by language ; this means that their configuration may differ.
///
/// Or you can just edit the groups one by one, but this may not be an ideal solution

/// On configuration files :
/// =======================================
///
/// - As far as I can attest, you can't hold only the files that interest you (lima-analysis/lima-lp) in one
/// directory and keep the rest in another. As far as it goes, you thus need to copy the entire config
/// directory even though most files won't change.
///
/// - The question is : do we create custom pipelines or custom config files ? I guess it's pipeline,
/// and in this case this should mean that it is independant of the selected language.
/// Then, what form would it take ?

/// You cannot specialize one -- Wait. It's possible. If you give it a different name while the same class,
/// it will work;
/// So you can have different versions of one pipeline unit with different names and parameters.
/// Same with dumpers and resources
/// /
/// - Ressources are called as parameters in pipeline units.
///
/// So, final questions :
///
///
/// How to use the least amount of files and the least amount of duplicates ?
/// How to organise custom configurations directories ?
/// How to render language and pipelines independant?
///
/// Creating a custom configuration will create a new set of configuration files.
/// Loading a custom configuration will require building on top of default configuration files and creating
/// a new analyser.
///
/// We need to have a class that enables overwriting a configuration structure with another.
///
/// Depends what files are required for resources and for CONF.

/// As for the configuration gui, we need:
/// - a list of all available process units and their description;
/// - a list of all parameters for each process unit
/// - a list of all possible values for every parameter they have;
/// - a list of all dependencies for each process unit

/// We may not have to overwrite configuration structures. Just load entire new ones.
