* Building easy steps (where $SRC_PATH is the path where source files have been downloaded) *
- create a path for binary files and go there with command shell
- run cmake $SRC_PATH -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$LIMA_DIST && make && make install
- configure command scripts in subdir commands/*  as needed
- if you need pelf-resedit, copy $SRC_PATH/src/PelfResourceTool/examples/pelf-rt-conf.[local|remote].xml as pelf-rt-conf.xml variable (or make a symbolic link), configure this XML file as needed and define the $PELF_CONF as the variable poiting to the containing directory
- if you need pelf-bench and an example file for bootstraping, copy the $SRC_PATH/src/PelfResourceTool/examples/* (contains lbp typical files and easy specific documents and reference files)
- go to bin subdirectory and run pelf-bench or pelf-resedit
